C code to complete the Micromouse floodfill simulator (https://github.com/mackorone/mms) using a weighted floodfill algorithm. Unlike traditional floodfill, which weights adjacent squares equally, this weighted floodfill algorithm can weigh adjacent squares, turns, and streaks of straight consecutive squares differently. Change TURN_SCORE, TILE_SCORE, and STREAK_SCORE in solver.c. Higher scores correspond to a higher penalty for making that move.
